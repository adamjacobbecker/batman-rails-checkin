## Batman-Rails-Checkin

### [View Live Site](http://batmanrailscheckin.herokuapp.com)

Batman-Rails-Checkin is a weekend hack that I embarked on so that I could experiment with the [batman.js](https://github.com/Shopify/batman) javascript framework. It ports our [MorningCheckin](https://github.com/cjoh/morning-checkin) application to a batman.js single-page app, backed by a RESTful API built with the [Rails-API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) project.

### How to use the app

MorningCheckin is a lightweight, mostly plaintext, day to day management application for small teams of great developers and service-oriented managers. This helps developers focus on what's important, and managers learn what's going on and who needs help. The system is designed around the concept of a quick check-in with the following components:

##### Get Done
Small, achievable goals that you plan on getting done today.

##### Got Done
The small achievable goals that you got done yesterday.

##### Flags
Flags can be coded R, Y, or G for Red, Yellow, and Green respectively. Red flags are flags that are stopping you from getting things done. Yellow flags are flags that might cause trouble, and green flags are causes for celebration, and/or unblocked obstacles.

Each member of a team submits a daily checkin with these components.

### batman.js lessons learned
These should eventually go into something longer, maybe a blogpost, but here's a few caveats I ran into with batman.js. It's possible some of these are due only to my ignorance, so feedback is much appreciated. Anyway:
